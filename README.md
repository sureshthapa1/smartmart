## Quick Start

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sureshthapa1/smartmart.git
cd smartmart
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure environment

Create a `.env` file:

```
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=development
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...            # Required for AI chat, autofill, image recognition, smart search
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...      # Optional locally; required for AI Advisor commentary
```

Generate a secret key:
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

Production/Render environment variables:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...            # Required for AI chatbot, autofill, image recognition
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...      # Optional — required for AI Advisor commentary
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=<random 32-byte hex>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...     # Render provides this automatically
```

### 3. Initialize database

```bash
flask --app run.py db upgrade
python seed.py        # optional: load sample data
```

After first deploy or after any model change:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python run.py
```

Open **http://127.0.0.1:5000** — default login: `admin` / (set during seed)

### Production

```bash
FLASK_ENV=production SECRET_KEY=your-key gunicorn "smart_mart.app:create_app('production')" --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 --workers 2
```

### Deployment

Render runs the configured build command in `render.yaml`, which installs dependencies and applies database migrations with:

```bash
flask --app run.py db upgrade
```

Run the same migration command after the first deploy and after every model change:

```bash
flask db upgrade
```

## Running Tests

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python -m pytest --tb=short
```

The suite covers unit, integration, and property-based tests (Hypothesis).
